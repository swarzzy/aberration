-- Reserve low entity instead of doing that mess woth low entities count schecking by count in loops can be usual.

-- Pass normalized mouse coords to the game from platform layer

** Quad trees in chunks

** Proportional integral derivative control for camera zoom

** _PLAYER_CONTROLLED_ enitity type...

-- Gizmos

##RENDERING:
-- Fixed size line vertex buffer. Use glBindBufferRange to fill it.
-- Terrain rendering
	** Generate meshes from tilemaps in chunks and render then with offset
	relative to camera targetWorldPos.
-- Water rendering
-- Line rendering
-- BRDF
-- Shadows
-- Fog and that noise based ambient _light-fog-filler_

-- Make that renderer and world have same coord orientation


## These are very old TODO's
-- Stop to crash entire app when EXT_swap_control is not supported

## PLATFORM
-- Unicode file names
-- Set bytes read to zero at the beginning of DebugReadFile function

!!!!!
## Renderer
-- Bug with colors when failed to load texture
-- Fix wrong face direction in font renderer
